    The Edmonton Food Drive Project aims to automate route assignment and improve pick-up efficiency based on area and donation volume. Use insights from the model to predict future donation patterns and refine strategies for continuous improvement. Enhance communication and coordination between Regional Coordinators, Stake Food Drive Representatives, and Ward Food Drive Representatives to streamline operations.

    The Edmonton City Food Drive project focuses on using machine learning to optimize food donation management in Edmonton by analyzing the data collected in 2023 and 2024. It aims to improve drop-off and pick-up efficiency, enhance route planning, and optimize resource allocation for a more effective food drive campaign.

    st.write("Data Collection Mechanisms and Analysis: Develop a digital system, such as an app or web portal (Google forum) to collect the information about the donations that include, route number, donation count, resources used, and many more in real-time. Use tools like Power BI to analyze data and identify the trends, peak donation times, and high-demand areas. Communication and coordination: Set up a centralized communication platform that allows Regional Coordinators, Stake Food Drive Representatives, and Ward Food Drive Representatives to communicate instantly, share updates, and assign tasks efficiently.Machine Learning and Route Planning Algorithms: The donation process would become more efficient by combining machine learning algorithms to find the optimal drop-off locations and route optimization algorithms for pick-ups based on factors such as donation density, distance, and time constraints. By using these two different algorithms, machine learning can predict the ideal spots for drop-offs and best pick-up routes.")
